What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?


Merge:

Merging in Git is like putting together changes from different branches. It's like mixing colors to make a new one. Git creates a special note to show everyone that these changes are now part of the main project.

Rebase:

Rebasing is like adjusting your work to start from the latest updates. It's like saying, "I want my work to fit in smoothly with the newest changes." It keeps things clean and simple, like arranging puzzle pieces neatly.
